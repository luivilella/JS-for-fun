# JavaScript for fun

Welcome to **js-for-fun**, the idea of this project is implement the same web page in more then one JS framework and compare the differences.

## Web page

The person using the site can search for and select a user by name.

Having selected a person by name, the user will see:
- A list of all posts for that user
- A table of the top 10 words (see below).
- A histogram (horizontal bar chart) of the top 10 words (see below).
